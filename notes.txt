Boost::bimap :
    -By using list_of, there's no need for pieceSprite ids.
    -The danger is that list implementation may invalidate pointer to sprite
    -Alternative is to have a const pointer to currentSprite and use bimap modify functions to set position

    -Now pieceSprite row and col are useless.

    Should add tags to make bimap more descriptive.

    currentPiece could hold an iterator instead of a pointer.

    bishop moves significant slowdown-moves stop registering after a few

    Wrap boost map in a class to improve code clarity

    make mini classes around the clocks

    put the move list in scrolled window, after fixing the slowdown

does isCheckSafe take into account color?

since we ensure boost::sign won't return 0, could we have better results with a faster one?

Must reinstate the boost assert that squares are distinct
Should we also assert that the piece to be move is the same color as the turns?

see how original bishop behaves with checkSafe off}
see how original bishop behaves with amended moves}
} still slow

see whether moving opponent piece should be allowed
improved checkSafe - we don't really need to know if both sides are in check
 --is there a way to turn parts of code off?
