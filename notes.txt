Boost::bimap :
    By using list_of, there's no need for pieceSprite ids.
    The danger is that list implementation may invalidate pointer to sprite
    Alternative is to have a const pointer to currentSprite and use bimap modify functions to set position

    Now pieceSprite row and col are useless.

    Should add tags to make bimap more descriptive.

    currentPiece could hold an iterator instead of a pointer.
